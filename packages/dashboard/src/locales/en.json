Use a GRADIENT MODERN design style.\n\nThe design should feel cutting-edge yet trustworthy—like stepping into a sleek command center where complex technology becomes effortlessly accessible. Typography should feel confident and forward-thinking. Use smooth, fluid animations that feel like liquid transitions between states. The color palette should feature sophisticated gradient transitions (purples, blues, teals) that create depth and dimension.\n\nDraw inspiration from premium technology experiences—the satisfying precision of well-crafted interfaces, the clarity of world-class products. The page should feel like a glimpse into the future of how work gets done.",
    "promptSaasDark": "Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE for a SaaS product: {{context}}. Use a DARK MODE ELEGANT design style.\n\nThe design should feel powerful and sophisticated—like a mission control center at night. Rich, deep backgrounds (near-black with subtle blue or purple undertones) with high-contrast text and glowing accent colors. Typography should feel sharp and precise. Subtle light effects—glows, subtle gradients—should make key elements feel luminous. Animations should feel smooth and purposeful.\n\nDraw inspiration from the drama of nighttime cityscapes, the focused intensity of professional creative tools, the premium feel of high-end audio equipment interfaces.",
    "promptSaasMinimal": "Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE for a SaaS product: {{context}}. Use a CLEAN MINIMAL / SWISS design style.\n\nThe design should feel crisp, confident, and systematically organized—every element placed with mathematical intention. Generous whitespace signals clarity of thought. Typography should be clean and highly legible, perhaps a refined sans-serif. A strict grid brings order. Colors should be restrained: perhaps just black, white, and one carefully chosen accent color.\n\nDraw inspiration from Swiss design principles, the clarity of well-organized information, the confidence that comes from knowing exactly what matters.",
    "promptAgencyEditorial": "Create a ONE-PAGE PORTFOLIO LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}.

High contrast colors (black, white, with punchy accents like electric yellow or hot pink). Typography should be oversized and commanding. Borders should be thick and visible. Elements might overlap intentionally. The aesthetic rejects polish in favor of impact.\n\nDraw inspiration from punk zines, protest posters, brutalist architecture, the energy of creative rebellion. The page should make a statement before visitors read a single word.",
    "promptAgencyElegant": "Create a ONE-PAGE PORTFOLIO LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}. Use an ELEGANT MINIMAL design style.\n\nThe design should feel like entering a pristine gallery—hushed, refined, where every detail has been considered. Extreme reduction: only what matters remains. Typography should be delicate yet confident, perhaps a refined serif or elegant sans-serif. Colors should be muted: warm whites, soft grays, perhaps a single accent. Animations should be subtle and unhurried.\n\nDraw inspiration from high-end galleries, luxury fashion presentations, the quiet confidence of spaces where quality speaks for itself.",
    "promptProductLuxury": "Create a ONE-PAGE PRODUCT LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}.

    "promptProductGlass": "Create a ONE-PAGE PRODUCT LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}. Use a GLASSMORPHISM design style.\n\nThe design should feel like peering through frosted glass into a world of depth and dimension. Translucent panels with backdrop blur effects create layers. Subtle borders catch light. The background should have gentle gradients or abstract shapes that show through the glass layers. Typography should be clean and modern. Colors should be soft but vibrant—perhaps pastels or gentle gradients.\n\nDraw inspiration from modern iOS interfaces, morning light through frosted windows, the layered depth of physical glass objects. The page should feel futuristic yet tactile.",
    "promptProductBold": "Create a ONE-PAGE PRODUCT LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}. Use a BOLD & VIBRANT design style.\n\nThe design should feel energetic, confident, and impossible to ignore. Bold, saturated colors that pop. Dynamic shapes—circles, waves, abstract forms—that create movement. Typography should be chunky and impactful. Animations should feel bouncy and playful. The overall effect should be joyful and energizing.\n\nDraw inspiration from pop art, modern packaging design, the boldness of brands that aren't afraid to stand out. Visitors should feel excited and energized.",
    "promptLocalWarm": "Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}. Use a WARM ORGANIC design style.\n\nThe design should feel like being welcomed into a thoughtfully designed space where you immediately want to stay. Warm, natural tones (terracotta, cream, sage, warm browns). Typography should feel approachable yet refined. Flowing, organic shapes soften the experience. Subtle animations should feel gentle and natural.\n\nDraw inspiration from Scandinavian hygge, the warmth of spaces where regulars are greeted by name, places where food is made with care. Visitors should feel hungry—not just for food, but for the experience.",
    "promptLocalModern": "Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}. Use a MODERN BISTRO design style.\n\nThe design should feel sophisticated yet approachable—like a restaurant where the food is serious but the atmosphere is relaxed. Clean lines with warm accents. Typography should balance modern and classic (perhaps a refined serif for headings). Colors should be sophisticated: deep greens, warm neutrals, perhaps brass or copper accents. Photos should feel editorial and appetizing.\n\nDraw inspiration from contemporary restaurant interiors, food photography in lifestyle magazines, the balance of casual and refined that defines modern dining.",
    "promptLocalRustic": "Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE for: {{context}}. Use a RUSTIC ARTISAN design style.\n\nThe design should feel handcrafted and authentic—like discovering a gem that's been perfected over generations. Textured backgrounds (subtle paper, wood grain). Typography with character—perhaps hand-drawn elements or vintage-inspired fonts. Warm, earthy colors (amber, deep red, cream, forest green). Elements should feel tactile and real.\n\nDraw inspiration from hand-painted signs, vintage menus, the patina of well-loved spaces, the authenticity of places where recipes are passed down through generations.",
